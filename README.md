# RedconeAlertApp

This is the Android app associated with an automated live detection system. Upon detecting any suspicious activity, the system sends reports to Firebase. The app then fetches details from Firebase and displays them in the app. Additionally, the app pushes notifications to all its users whenever something new is detected.
